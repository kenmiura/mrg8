MRG8
======

## Versions
2.1 (March, 2019)

## Introduction
This is a pseudorandom number generator based on the 8th order primitive polynomial modulo 2^31-1. This polynomial was provided by Prof. P. Lâ€™Ecuyer of Montreal University.
The MRG8 firstly appeared in (1), and further optimized version was proposed in (2) later.

## Components and Requirement
### C/Fortran version (./original)
 - Nothing special
### CUDA version (./cuda)
 - CUDA: >= 5.0
 - Compute capability: >= 3.5
 - Use of cuRAND library for test program (MRG8 itself does not require)
### KNL version (./knl)
 - OpenMP
 - Use of Intel MKL library for test program (MRG8 itself does not require)

## Run sample program
### Preparation
To use this library, the first thing you need to do is to modify the Makefile with correct CUDA/Intel Compiler installation path. The compute capability for CUDA is also appropriately set.
### CUDA version
 - Compile with Makefile: make test
   - This command generates all test executable file including cuRAND library.
 - Run on KNL processor: './bin/test_mrg8_outer 16'
   - First argument is the number of RNGs to be generated (* 2^20). Above example means "MRG8 optimized for NVIDIA GPU generates 2^24 of RNGs".

### KNL version
 - Compile with Makefile: make test
   - This command generates all test executable file including Intel MKL
 - Run on KNL processor: './bin/test_mrg8_vec_outer_tp 16'
   - First argument is the number of RNGs to be generated (* 2^20). Above example means "MRG8 with AVX-512 and full threads generates 2^24 of RNGs".

## To use with your own program
### CUDA version
'make build' provides static library of MRG8-CUDA, generating 'libmrg8.a'. Copy 'mrg8.h' and 'mrg8_cuda.h' to your codes. To use the library, add include mrg8_vec.h in your code, and compile with 'libmrg8.a'.

### KNL version
Copy 'mrg8.h' and 'mrg8_vec.h' to your codes. To use the library, include file (mrg8_vec.h) in your code.
